PicGrab2 (Not just for pictures)


What PicGrab does:

PicGrab 'crawls' webpages looking for file downloads
for types of file you specify. So it isn't just limited
to pictures anymore. For example, you can download
RAR collections and also videos too.

Note that for a file to be downloaded, it needs to have
a link to it and it is not just shown on the page - for 
example, banners and thumbnails won't and can't be 
downloaded.






Basic Instructions:

1.

Find some pages with thumbnail galleries or links to pages
with thumbnail galleries or lists of links to downloadable 
files.

(ie. http://www.picHunter.com - porn images
     http://www.rom-world.com/dl.php?name=Gameboy&letter=B  - Gameboy ROMS)

2.
For each page, type it in up the top and click 'Add URL'


3.
Configure the 'Grab':


Maximum Link Depth (Bottom right):
	This is an important one. This tells PicGrab2 how 
	'deep' to crawl, so if you want it to only browse
	the URLs you entered, set it as 1. If you want it
	to visit every link on the URL but go no deeper, set
	it as 2. If you want it to browse the links found on
	pages linked by the original URL, set it as 3, and so on.


Allow extentions:
	If this is checked, then pages NOT ending with
	the specified values (Separated by commas)
	will not be browsed (experiment with this
	to optimize speed)


Disallow extentions:
	This does the opposite to allow extentions.


File Types:
	If this is checked then any extentions entered into
	the corrosponding textbox will be downloaded if
	found. Separate multiple entries with spaces
	(ie. jpg,mpeg)

Content Types: 
	This option is useful to stop corrupted files, for 
	example when trying to download a jpeg file, the 
	server redirects you to a HTML file.
	Basically, use image for images, video for videos,
	text for html/text, and * for anything else.


You can save these settings to a 'Profile' for re-use.


4. 
Click 'Start Grabbing' and let the magic take place...

An image could is found below the list of webpages, use
this as an indicator of the quality of your settings...

PicGrab2 may not be able to download some files, but it
can download most...


5.
When the 'Grab' is finished, you can click 'Save Images'
and follow your nose.

-OR-

Save the image list to download later or to batch-download 
later (by loading all of your saved image lists and then
saving them all by clicking 'Save Images'.






GRAB AND GO

This will automate the process by asking you the file saving
settings first and then grabbing and automatically downloading
and saving. Great for overnight downloads. Great for chronic
masturbaters!
